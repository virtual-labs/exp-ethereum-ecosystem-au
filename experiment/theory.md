<u><h3>Theory</h3></u>

<h4>Ethereum Wallets</h4>
<p>Ethereum wallets are software programs or hardware devices that allow you to store, send, and receive Ethereum (ETH) and other ERC-20 tokens. Wallets are essential for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain and using decentralized applications (DApps).

There are two main types of Ethereum wallets: hot wallets and cold wallets. Hot wallets are connected to the internet, while cold wallets are stored offline. Hot wallets are more convenient to use, but they are also more vulnerable to hacking. Cold wallets are less convenient to use, but they are also more secure.

<h4>Metamask</h4>
<p>MetaMask is a hot wallet that allows users to interact with the Ethereum blockchain. It can be used to store Ethereum , as well as connect to decentralized applications (dapps).</p>
<p>
MetaMask is a non-custodial wallet, which means that users have full control over their private keys and funds. This makes MetaMask a more secure way to store cryptocurrency than a custodial wallet, where the private keys are held by a third party.

<h4>
MetaMask Transactions</h4>
<p>MetaMask transactions are the essential components of interactions on the Ethereum blockchain. They enable the transfer of assets, the execution of smart contracts, and the utilization of decentralized applications (DApps). MetaMask transactions encompass sending, buying, selling, and receiving cryptocurrency.</p>

<h6>A MetaMask transaction is composed of several essential elements:</h6>
<p>From Address: The Ethereum address of the sender initiating the transaction.</p>

<p>To Address: The Ethereum address of the recipient, designated to receive the transferred assets or interact with the targeted smart contract.</p>

<p>Value: The amount of cryptocurrency being transferred, measured in Ether (ETH) or other supported tokens.</p>

<p>Gas Price: The fee paid to miners for processing the transaction.</p>
